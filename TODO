* Improve the search status graphics and "odometer" numerals.
* Split the solver into a front-end and back-end so the algorithm can be
  more easily re-used.
* Option to filter games on solvability.
* A random number generator with a longer period would be nice.
* Make cell graphics scale with cell size.
* Internationalization.
